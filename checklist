#1 Simple conversion management:
	-Simply check each conversion without any flags 'cspdiuxX%'
	-Try special cases like 0 or smallest int or empty string or null pointer
	-Try with multiple arguments/conversions
	-Try the various conversions in the middle of a sentence (with other characters before and/or after)

#2 Simple Flags management:
	-Use the 's' conversion for all the following test
	-Check the minimum field width with values bigger, equal and smaller than the string
	-Check the minimum field width with values bigger, equal and smaller than the string with -
	-Check the minimum field width with values bigger, equal and smaller than the string with 0
	-Check the '.' with multiple precisions

#3 Advance flags management:
	-Use the 's' conversion for all the following test
	-Check '*' as minimum field width (try values like negative one, zero etc)
	-Check '*' as precision (try values like negative one, zero etc)
	-Check '*' as both with/without one other flag (try values like negative one, zero etc)

#4 Get crazy:
	-Try any combinations of flags and conversions
	-Check what happen with duplicate flags
